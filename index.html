    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>When out of nowhere, <strong>dinosaurs</strong> crashed through the trees!</p>
    <p>Followed by a strange man in a spacesuit! "Shouldn't have done that," said the man.</p>
    <p>I was confused by the semantic ambiguity of the man's statement.  "<em>You</em> shouldn't have done that, or <em>I</em> shouldn't have done that?" I asked. Nevermind that I had no idea what <em>I</em> possibly could have done, other than camp in a spot that was improbably plagued by dinosaurs.</p>
    <p> The man in the spacesuit turned to look at me. "Oh, sorry didn't see you there." The man seemed concerned what with all of the dinosaurs, but he looked in my eyes and with a stern voice said "This is all a dream and has absolutely nothing to do with the secret government lab nearby."</p>
    <p>"Oh, that's comforting," I muttered, not believing him in the slightest.</p>
    <p>"May I have a marshmallow?" asked the man pointing to the half full bag of jet-puffed goodness. "My dinosaurs love marshmallows, it's how we train them."</p>
    <p>Now this I had to see. I reached into the bag and pulled out a marshmallow. "Do they do tricks?"</p>
    <p>"Yes! They know how to sit and play fetch," said the man.</p>
    <p>"My dog can do that" I said, handing the marshmallow to the spaceman.</p>
    <p>"Yes," said the man. "That's why we chose canine DNA. ...I shouldn't have told you that."</p>
    <p>"Well, if it's a dream, it doesn't matter, right? I can tell whoever I want, and they'll never believe me." I quickly realized that <strong>I</strong> shouldn't have said that. If the spaceman thought that I would say something... I silently hoped that he wouldn't become suspicious.</p>
