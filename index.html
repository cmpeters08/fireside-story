    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>When out of nowhere, <strong>dinosaurs</strong> crashed through the trees!</p>
    <p>Followed by a strange man in a spacesuit! "Shouldn't have done that," said the man.</p>
    <p>I was confused by the semantic ambiguity of the man's statement.  "<em>You</em> shouldn't have done that, or <em>I</em> shouldn't have done that?" I asked. Nevermind that I had no idea what <em>I</em> possibly could have done, other than camp in a spot that was improbably plagued by dinosaurs.</p>
