This is a LaunchCode Immersive CodeCamp assignment designed to teach the contributors more about git merges and best practices.
The exercise serves three purposes:
1. Give aspiring programmers practice with routine tasks such as pushing, pulling, and merging branches.
2. Demonstrate potential consequences when more than one contributor works on the same file or issue and/or puts too many changes into the same commit.
3. Encourage creative thinking.
